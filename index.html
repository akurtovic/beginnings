When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn't have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt.</p>

					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="mockingbirdText">When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.</p>

						<p class="duneText"><span class="duneFirstLetter">I</span>n the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul.</p>
						<p class="duneText">It was a warm night Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.</p>
						<p class="duneText">The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.</p>
						<p class="duneText">By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakaned boy could bee a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="duneText"> The old woman was a witch shadow--hair like matter spiderwebs, hooded round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.</p>
						<p class="duneText">"Is he not small for his age, Jessica?" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.</p>
						<p class="duneText">Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: "The Atreides are known to start late getting their growth, Your Reverence."</p>
						<p class="duneText">"So I've heard, so I've heard," wheezed the old woman. "Yet he's already fifteen."</p>
						<p class="duneText">"Yes, Your Reverence."</p>
						<p class="duneText">"He's awake and listening to us," said the old woman. "Sly little rascal." She chuckled. "But royalty has need of slyness. And if he really is the Kwisatz Haderach...well..."</p>
