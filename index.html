Each section is composed of the title and opening paragraphs of some of my favorite books, set in a mix of fonts that work well together. Hover over each title or paragraph to get the name of the font, or click to go directly to the Google fonts page. And if you don't fall in love with any fonts, perhaps you will discover an interesting book.</p>

						<p class="duneText"><span class="duneFirstLetter">I</span>n the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul.</p>
						<p class="duneText">It was a warm night Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.</p>
						<p class="duneText">The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.</p>
						<p class="duneText">By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakaned boy could bee a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother.</p>

					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="duneText"> The old woman was a witch shadow--hair like matter spiderwebs, hooded round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.</p>
						<p class="duneText">"Is he not small for his age, Jessica?" the old woman asked. Her voice wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.</p>

						<p class="duneText">"So I've heard, so I've heard," wheezed the old woman. "Yet he's already fifteen."</p>
						<p class="duneText">"Yes, Your Reverence."</p>
						<p class="duneText">"He's awake and listening to us," said the old woman. "Sly little rascal." She chuckled. "But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really te Kwisatz Haderach...well..."</p>
